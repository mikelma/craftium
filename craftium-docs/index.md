‚ú® *Imagine the richness of Minecraft: open worlds, procedural generation, fully destructible voxel environments... but open source, without Java, easily extensible in [Lua](https://www.lua.org), and with the modern [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) and [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/) APIs for AI single-and multi-agent research... This is* **Craftium!** ‚ú®

[Craftium](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a fully open-source platform for creating fast, rich, and diverse **single and multi-agent** environments. Craftium is based on the amazing [Luanti](https://www.luanti.org/) voxel game engine and the popular [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) and [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/) APIs.

Check the [installation](./installation.md) instructions and the [getting started](./getting-started.md) pages to start using craftium!

## Features ‚ú®

- **Super extensible üß©:** Luanti is built with modding in mind! The game engine is completely extensible using the [Lua](https://www.lua.org) programming language. Easily create mods to implement the environment that suits the needs of your research! See [environments](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments/) for a showcase of what is possible with craftium.

- **Blazingly fast ‚ö°:** Craftium achieves +2K steps per second more than Minecraft-based alternatives! Environment richness, 3D, computational efficiency all meet in craftium!

- **Extensive documentation üìö:** Craftium extensively [documents](https://craftium.readthedocs.io) how to [use](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/) existing [environments](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments) and [create](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/creating-envs/) new ones. The documentation also includes a low-level [reference](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/) of the exported Python classes and gymnasium [Wrappers](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wrappers/), [extensions to the Lua API](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lua_functions/), and [code examples](https://craftium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lua_env_cookbook/). Moreover, Craftium greatly benefits from existing Luanti documentation like the [wiki](https://wiki.luanti.org/), [reference](https://api.luanti.org/), and [modding book](https://rubenwardy.com/minetest_modding_book/en/basics/getting_started.html).

- **Modern API ü§ñ:** Craftium implements the well-known [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html)'s [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/) APIs, opening the door to a huge number of existing tools and libraries compatible with these APIs. For example, [stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io) or [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) (check [examples](#examples-) section!).

- **Fully open source ü§†:** Both, craftium and Luanti are fully open-source projects. This allowed us to modify Luanti's source code to tightly integrate it with our library, reducing the number of ugly hacks.

- **No more Java üëπ:** The Minecraft game is written in Java, not a very friendly language for clusters and high-performance applications. Contrarily, Luanti is written in C++, much more friendly for clusters, and highly performant!
